# LALR: Layer-Adaptive Learning Rate Fine-Tuning Using Sequential Scaling Metrics

## Abstract

The Layer-Adaptive Learning Rate (LALR) Fine-Tuning approach described in this paper uses static analysis of a language model's weights within each layer to proportionally adjust the learning rates based on layer-specific contributions to the model’s performances, to improve: 

- Overall function, measured by singular value decomposition (SVD)
- Relative information between layers, measured by cross-entropy (CE)
- Relative diversity between layers, measured by cosine similiarity (CS)

LALR draws motivation from observations in cognitive science and neuroscience, suggesting that human learning involves selective strengthening of certain neural pathways and preservation of others [8]. By mimicking this selective enhancement in artificial neural networks, LALR aims to achieve efficient and effective fine-tuning, leading to more robust and versatile adapted models through the following:

- Controlled undertraining: Selectively reduces learning rates for well-optimized layers, intentionally risking undertraining to prevent overfitting.
- Capacity optimization: Focuses training on underutilized layers, extracting more performance from the existing model structure without increasing model size.
- Knowledge preservation: Intend to "undertrain" well-optimized layers in pre-trained models, to help preserve valuable pre-trained knowledge while adapting to new tasks.
- Adaptive fine-tuning: Dynamically manages undertraining risk by adjusting the learning rate scaling based on the current state of each layer after each training epoch. 
- Exploration-exploitation balance: Encourages exploration of different internal representations by focusing fine-tuning on less optimized layers, to encourage a more robust and versatile fine-tuned model.

## 1.0 Background and Related Work

Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, from question answering to complex reasoning [1]. However, these models often struggle with generalization and exhibit brittle behavior when faced with out-of-distribution data or subtle input variations as they grow in size and complexity [2]. Traditional fine-tuning approaches often treat all layers of a model equally, applying uniform learning rates or optimization strategies across the entire network. Different layers in large language models often specialize in capturing different levels of linguistic and semantic information [6], suggesting that a layer-specific approach to fine-tuning could yield better results. Several lines of research have explored methods to improve model robustness and generalization:

- **Selective Layer Modification:** Layer-Selective Rank Reduction (LASER) [3] identifies and prunes less important layers to reduce model size while maintaining performance. While effective for model compression, this approach doesn't address the potential of enhancing underutilized layers to maintain the intrinsic fine-tuning potential based on the model's intrinsic dimensionality [9].

- **Output Diversity:** Entropy-based training strategies [4] encourage more diverse model outputs for improving generalization. However, these methods typically focus on the model's output rather than its internal representations.

- **Adaptive Optimization:** Adaptive learning rate methods [5] have shown promise in improving training efficiency and model performance. Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS) [11] and Layer-wise Adaptive Moments (LAMB) [12] have demonstrated significant improvements in training large neural networks with large batch sizes. LARS adapts the learning rate for each layer based on the ratio of the L2 norm of the layer's weights to the L2 norm of its gradient, while LAMB extends this idea to work with adaptive moment estimation. While effective for initial training, these methods focus on weight and gradient magnitudes but are not specifically designed for the fine-tuning phase of pre-trained models.

- **Information Theory in Neural Networks:** Recent work has explored the application of information theory to understand and optimize neural networks [7]. These approaches provide insights into the information flow within networks but have not been fully leveraged in fine-tuning strategies.

Building upon these foundations, the proposed method offers a novel approach tailored for fine-tuning large language models. It combines concepts from linear algebra (SVD), information theory (CE), and representation learning (CS) to provide a comprehensive analysis of layer contributions. This new LALR approach:

- Incorporates distinct SVD, CE, and CS metrics to analyze layer contributions without requiring computationally expensive gradient assessments.
- Targets underutilized, less informative, and redundant layers for optimization, allowing for efficient use of model capacity.
- Focuses on the unique challenges of fine-tuning pre-trained models, where the goal is to refine existing knowledge rather than learn from scratch.

## 2.0 Learning Rate Scaling Metrics

LALR computes metrics using the model weights to obtain a per-layer scaling factor to lower learning rates of those layers that have lower SVD, relative CE, and higher relative CS.

### **2.1 SVD Metric**

SVD factorizes a matrix A into the product of three matrices: $A = UΣV^T$, where $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices, and $Σ$ is a diagonal matrix containing singular values. These values represent the importance of different directions in the matrix's transformation, with larger values indicating more significant directions. In neural networks, SVD of weight matrices reveals the layer's capacity to represent and transform features.

Let $λ_{i,k}$ be the $k$-th singular value of the weight matrix of layer $i$, sorted in descending order. The initial SVD-based contribution metric for layer $i$ is defined as:

$M_{SVD}'(i) = (1 / (L-1)) ∑_{k=1}^{L-1} λ_{i,k}$

where $L$ is the total number of singular values. The final metric after normalizing is obtained after subtracting from 1, to obtain the scaling factor to apply to the learning rate for each layer.

Metric Computation:
1. Perform SVD on each layer's weight matrix
2. Calculate the mean of the singular values
3. Normalize the metric to range from 0 to 1
4. Subtract from 1 to prioritize lower SVD layers

Scaling the learning rate in each layer by $M_{SVD}(i)$ aims to:
- Preserve learned hierarchical representations in well-optimized layers
- Enhance complex feature learning in underutilized layers
- Improve signal-to-noise ratio in representations
- Optimize model capacity usage
- Increase training stability and convergence

### **2.2 CE Metric**

CE measures the difference between two probability distributions. For discrete probability distributions $P$ and $Q$, CE is defined as $CE(P, Q) = -∑ P(x) log Q(x)$. In neural networks, CE quantifies the dissimilarity between weight distributions of different layers, treating normalized weight values as probability distributions.

Let $p_i$ be the normalized weight distribution of layer $i$, and $p_j$ be the normalized weight distribution of another layer $j$. The cross-entropy $CE(p_i, p_j)$ between the distributions $p_i$ and $p_j$ is:

$CE(p_i, p_j) = -∑_k p_i(k) log(p_j(k))$

The initial CE metric for layer $i$ is:

$M_{CE}'(i) = (1 / (L-1)) ∑_{j≠i} CE(p_i, p_j)$

where $L$ is the total number of layers. The final metric after normalizing is obtained after subtracting from 1, to obtain the scaling factor to apply to the learning rate for each layer.

Metric Computation:
1. Flatten and normalize weight tensors to create probability distributions
2. Compute CE between each layer's distribution and every other layer's distribution
3. Average these values to obtain the initial CE metric for each layer
4. Add a small constant to prevent logarithm of zero
5. Normalize the metric to range from 0 to 1
6. Subtract from 1 to obtain the final CE metric

Scaling the learning rate in each layer by $M_{CE}(i)$ aims to:
- Maintain information content in dense model layers
- Diversify learned representations across layers
- Capture task-specific information efficiently
- Improve handling of diverse inputs
- Discover novel, task-relevant features in underutilized layers
- Enhance hierarchical feature representation

### **2.3 CS Metric**

CS measures similarity between two non-zero vectors in an inner product space, revealing functional redundancy in the neural network layers. For vectors $A$ and $B$, CS is defined as $cos(θ) = (A · B) / (||A|| ||B||)$, where $||x||$ is the vector magnitude. 

Let $w_i$ and $w_j$ be the flattened weight vectors of layers $i$ and $j$. The CS between these layers is:

$CS(i, j) = (w_i · w_j) / (||w_i|| ||w_j||)$

The average CS of a layer with all other layers is:

$M_{CS}(i) = (1 / (L-1)) ∑_{j≠i} CS(i, j)$

where $L$ is the total number of layers. The final metric after normalizing provides the scaling factor to apply to the learning rate for each layer.

Metric Computation:
1. Flatten weight tensors into vectors
2. Compute CS between each layer pair using normalized weight vectors
3. Calculate each layer's average similarity with all others
4. Normalize the final metric to range from 0 to 1

Scaling the learning rate in each layer by $M_{CS}(i)$ aims to:
- Preserve existing diversity in unique layers
- Enhance feature and pattern capture capacity
- Allocate model capacity efficiently
- Improve training efficiency and convergence
- Optimize information propagation
- Adapt pre-trained models effectively to specific tasks
- Enhance generalization by preventing overfitting to specific layer interactions

### **2.4 Robust Normalization of Layer-wise Metrics**

LALR employs the following robust normalization approach to ensure a more effective utilization of the SVD, CE, and CS metrics across the different layers to promote fine-tuning stability and effectiveness:

1. Metric Calculation: Compute raw SVD, CE, and CS metrics for each layer.
2. Outlier Mitigation: Using the mean values across layers for the metrics ensures resilience against outliers due to the Central Limit Theorem so that metrics represent each layer's relationship to the entire network rather than being skewed by individual extreme comparisons.
3. Normalization Process: Normalize each metric to [0, 1] range using:

normalized metric = $(metric - min(metric)) / (max(metric) - min(metric))$

This normalization approach ensures:
- Comparability between metrics and layers
- Scalability across model sizes and architectures
- Robustness through reduced sensitivity to outliers
- Interpretability via intuitive [0, 1] range.

## 3.0 Layer-Adaptive Learning Rate (LALR) Fine-Tuning

LALR dynamically adjusts learning rates based on layer-specific metrics, effecting more weight changes in underutilized, lower information content, and redundant layers. It encourages diverse internal representations across the model. The sequential application of SVD, CE, and CS metrics progressively enhances the model's weights, optimizing representations comprehensively. LALR computes the layer-wise SVD, CE, and CS metrics only once per epoch, which requires very small additional computation compared to the fine-tuning process itself.

### **3.1 Theoretical Foundation**

The model's objective or loss function, represented by $J(\theta)$, quantifies the difference between the model's acutal output and expected output defined in the training data. The fine-tuning process reduces $J(\theta)$ to improve the model's performance on the training data examples. However, overfitting can occur if the model is optimized too closely to the training data, which reduces the models ability to generalize. The LALR approach aims to reduce both $J(\theta)$ and overfitting by focusing the fine-tuning on the underutilized, lower information content, and redundant layers as determined by the SVD, CE, and CS metrics.

$J(\theta) = f(M_{SVD}(1), \ldots, M_{SVD}(L), M_{CE}(1), \ldots, M_{CE}(L), M_{CS}(1), \ldots, M_{CS}(L))$

where $M_{SVD}(i)$, $M_{CE}(i)$, and $M_{CS}(i)$ are the SVD, CE, and CS metrics for layer $i$, respectively, and $L$ is the number of layers.

The optimization of $J(\theta)$ is guided by the following relationships:

- $\frac{\partial J}{\partial M_{SVD}(i)} > \frac{\partial J}{\partial M_{CE}(i)} > \frac{\partial J}{\partial M_{CS}(i)}$ initially.
- Optimizing $M_{SVD}(i)$ increases $\frac{\partial J}{\partial M_{CE}(i)}$: $\frac{\partial^2 J}{\partial M_{SVD}(i) \partial M_{CE}(i)} > 0$
- Optimizing $M_{CE}(i)$ increases $\frac{\partial J}{\partial M_{CS}(i)}$: $\frac{\partial^2 J}{\partial M_{CE}(i) \partial M_{CS}(i)} > 0$

This sequence maximizes these interaction effects, leading to improvements in $J(\theta)$ by exploiting their interdependencies based on the relationship between metrics and model performance, the metric interaction, and bounding analysis detailed in Appendix B:

1. Metric Improvements and $J(θ)$: Improvements in each metric correlate with reductions in the objective function $J(θ)$ based on the following (Section B.2.3):
   - For $M_{SVD}: E[ΔJ(θ)] ≈ -∇J(θ)^T (∂θ/∂M_{SVD} * E[ΔM_SVD]) > 0$ when $ΔM_{SVD} > 0$
   - For $M_{CE}: E[ΔJ(θ)] ≈ -∇J(θ)^T (∂θ/∂M_{CE} * E[ΔM_{CE}]) > 0$ when $ΔM_{CE} > 0$
   - For $M_{CS}: E[ΔJ(θ)] ≈ ∇J(θ)^T (∂θ/∂M_{CS} * E[ΔM_{CS}]) < 0$ when $ΔM_{CS} < 0$

2. SVD Optimization: Expands the effective rank of weight matrices, creating capacity for new, task-specific information (Section B.2.2).
   - Mathematical Basis: $\frac{\partial J}{\partial M_{SVD}(i)} \approx \log(\text{rank}(W_i))$

3. CE Optimization: Leverages increased capacity to learn unique, task-specific features (Section B.2.2).
   - Mathematical Basis: $\frac{\partial J}{\partial M_{CE}(i)} \approx H(W_i \mid W_j, j \neq i)$, where $H$ is the conditional entropy

4. CS Optimization: Refines learned features, ensuring efficient use of model capacity (Section B.2.2).
   - Mathematical Basis: $\frac{\partial J}{\partial M_{CS}(i)} \approx -\cos(W_i, W_j), j \neq i$

5. SVD -> CE -> CS Sequence Justification:
   - Foundation Building: SVD optimization establishes a robust foundation, amplifying subsequent optimizations (Section B.3.2.5, Theorems B.3.2.5.1 and B.3.2.5.2).
   - Cascading Enhancements: CE optimization magnifies SVD improvements, and CS optimization leverages both SVD and CE enhancements (Sections B.3.2.1, B.3.2.2, and B.3.2.3, Theorems 3.2.1.1, 3.2.2.1, and 3.2.3.1).
   - Interaction Constraints: Bounded interactions ensure stable sequential optimization (Section B.3.2.5, Theorem B.3.2.5.1).
   - Adaptive Execution: Each phase recalibrates based on the model's current state, ensuring responsiveness to prior optimizations (Section B.3.2.4).

This theoretical foundation illustrates how LALR's approach for sequential fine-tuning using the SVD, CE, and CS metrics provides framework for dynamically adjusting learning rates across layers and epochs to enhance the desired aspects of the models weight structure.

### 3.2 Implementation and Integration

The example code provided in Appendix A provides a practical LALR implementation that aligns with the theoretical foundations discussed in this paper to showcases how LALR can be applied to real-world deep learning optimization tasks. The AdaptiveOptimizer class encapsulates the core functionality of LALR, including the computation of layer-wise SVD, CE, and CS metrics, and the adjustment of learning rates based on these metrics. The adaptive_fine_tuning function illustrates how the optimizer can be integrated into a typical fine-tuning pipeline, with the sequential optimization of SVD, CE, and CS metrics over multiple epochs. 

LALR can also integrate with existing per-batch adaptive learning rate methods, such as AdamW[13], by scaling the learning rate for each layer $l$ at epoch $e$ by:

$lr_{l,e} = lr_{per-batch,l,e} × scale_{layer-wise,l,e}$

This integration adapts the learning rate at both per-weight and per-layer levels, accounting for gradient dynamics and global layer properties. 

### 3.3 Benefits and Outcomes

LALR represents strategy that enhances model performance and generalization with minimal computational burden, making it a practical and efficient approach for fine-tuning large language models.

LALR intends to achieve the following outcome by combining the metric computation, normalization, and fine-tuning sequences:  

- Targeted Optimization: Enhances overall model capacity and functional diversity, accelerating learning of distinctive features in underperforming layers.
- Adaptive Exploration: Discovers unique features and escapes local optima, improving generalization across tasks and datasets.
- Structural Regularization: Increases robustness to overfitting, improves adaptability to new data, and enhances stability during fine-tuning.
- Overfitting Protection: Promotes learning of generalizable patterns rather than memorizing training data.
- Stability Preservation: Maintains baseline performance by scaling down learning rates for well-optimized layers.
- Efficient Capacity Utilization: Captures generalizable features without increasing model size.
- Versatility Enhancement: Improves model performance and adaptability.

## B.2 Metrics and Model Performance Relationship

### B.2.1 Objective Function $J(θ)$ Definition

In the context of neural networks, the objective function $J(θ)$ typically represents a loss function that we aim to minimize during training:

$J(θ) = (1/N) ∑_{i=1}^N L(y_i, f(x_i; θ)) + λR(θ)$

Where:
- $N$ is the number of training samples
- $θ$ represents all trainable parameters of the model
- $L$ is the per-sample loss function
- $y_i$ is the true label (or target value) for sample $i$
- $x_i$ is the input feature vector for sample $i$
- $f(x_i; θ)$ is the model's prediction for sample $i$
- $λ$ is a regularization coefficient
- $R(θ)$ is a regularization term

Breaking this down further:

1. Loss function $L$: Depending on the task, $L$ could be:
- Cross-entropy loss for classification: $L(y, ŷ) = -∑_j y_j log(ŷ_j)$
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression: $L(y, ŷ) = (y - ŷ)²$

   where $y$ is a one-hot encoded vector and $ŷ$ is the model's softmax output

2. Model function $f(x; θ)$: For a neural network with $L$ layers: 
   
   $f(x; θ) = f_L(f_{L-1}(...f_1(x; θ_1)...; θ_{L-1}); θ_L)$, where $f_l$ represents the function of the $l$-th layer, and $θ_l$ are the parameters of that layer.

3. Regularization term $R(θ)$: This term helps prevent overfitting. Common choices include:
- L2 regularization: $R(θ) = ∑_k θ_k²$
- L1 regularization: $R(θ) = ∑_k |θ_k|$

As applied to the objective metrics:

1. SVD Metric ($M_{SVD}$):

   For a given layer $l$, $M_{SVD}(l)$ affects the capacity of $f_l$, intended to determine the expressiveness of $f(x; θ)$.

2. Cross-Entropy Metric ($M_{CE}$):
   
   $M_{CE}(l)$ measures the uniqueness of layer $l$ compared to other layers, intended to determine how diverse the features are across layers in $f(x; θ)$.

3. Cosine Similarity Metric ($M_{CS}$):
   
   $M_{CS}(l)$ measures how similar layer $l$ is to other layers, intended to determine redundancy in $f(x; θ)$.

Goal is to prove that optimizing these metrics leads to a reduction in $J(θ)$:

- $∂J/∂M_{SVD}(l) > 0$
- $∂J/∂M_{CE}(l) > 0$
- $∂J/∂M_{CS}(l) < 0$

For each layer $l$, under the assumption that lower values of these metrics are better (note the direction of inequality for $M_{SVD}$ and $M_{CE}$ are flipped because we want to minimize these metrics).

### B.2.2 Partial Derivatives and Inequalities

1. SVD Metric ($M_{SVD}$):

   The goal is to prove $∂J/∂M_{SVD}(l) > 0$, since lower SVD values (higher 1 - $M_{SVD}$) should lead to higher learning rates.

   Using the chain rule:
   
   $∂J/∂M_{SVD}(l) = ∂J/∂θ_l * ∂θ_l/∂M_{SVD}(l)$

   a) $∂J/∂θ_l$ remains the same:
      
      $∂J/∂θ_l = (1/N) ∑_{i=1}^N ∂L(y_i, f(x_i; θ))/∂θ_l + λ∂R(θ)/∂θ_l$

   b) $∂θ_l/∂M_{SVD}(l)$ needs to be adjusted:
      
      $∂θ_l/∂M_{SVD}(l) ≈ -r * (U_l V_l^T)$  (note the negative sign due to the 1 - $M_{SVD}$ scaling)

   c) Combining these:

      $∂J/∂M_{SVD}(l) ≈ -(1/N) ∑_{i=1}^N ∂L(y_i, f(x_i; θ))/∂θ_l * r * (U_l V_l^T) - λ∂R(θ)/∂θ_l * r * (U_l V_l^T)$

   d) Increasing $M_{SVD}(l)$ decreases the learning rate for that layer, which should increase loss. Thus, $∂J/∂M_{SVD}(l) > 0$.

2. CE Metric ($M_{CE}$):

   The goal is to prove $∂J/∂M_{CE}(l) > 0$, since lower CE values (higher 1 - $M_{CE}$) should lead to higher learning rates.

   a) $M_{CE}(l)$ expression remains the same:
   
      $M_{CE}(l) = (1/(L-1)) ∑_{k≠l} CE(p_l, p_k)$

   b) The relationship between $M_{CE}(l)$ and information content $I_l$ needs to be adjusted:
   
      $ΔI_l ≈ Δ(1 - M_{CE}(l)) = -ΔM_{CE}(l)$

   c) The relationship between information content and loss remains the same:
   
      $∂J/∂I_l < 0$

   d) Combining these:

      $∂J/∂M_{CE}(l) ≈ -∂J/∂I_l > 0$

3. CS Metric ($M_{CS}$):

   For $M_{CS}$, lower values already correspond to higher learning rates, so no correction is needed. The goal remains to prove $∂J/∂M_{CS}(l) > 0$.

   a) $M_{CS}(l)$ expression remains the same:

      $M_{CS}(l) = (1/(L-1)) ∑_{k≠l} (w_l · w_k) / (||w_l|| ||w_k||)$

   b) The relationship between $M_{CS}(l)$ and orthogonality $O_l$ remains:

      $ΔO_l ≈ -ΔM_{CS}(l)$

   c) The relationship between orthogonality and loss remains the same:

      $∂J/∂O_l < 0$

   d) Combining these:

      $∂J/∂M_{CS}(l) ≈ -∂J/∂O_l > 0$

### B.2.3 Metric Improvements and J(θ) Correlation

   For each metric $M ∈ {M_{SVD}, M_{CE}, M_{CS}}$, this section aims to prove:
      
   For $M_{SVD}$ and $M_{CE}$: 
   
   $ΔM_i > 0 ⇒ E[ΔJ(θ)] > 0$ 
   
   For $M_{CS}$: 
   
   $ΔM_i < 0 ⇒ E[ΔJ(θ)] < 0$, where $ΔM_i$ is the change in metric $M$ for layer $i$, and $E[ΔJ(θ)]$ is the expected change in the objective function.

1. Taylor Expansion of $J(θ)$:

   Let $θ'$ be the updated parameters after a change in metric $M_i$. $J(θ')$ can be expressed using a second-order Taylor expansion around $θ$ [5][27]:
   
   $J(θ') ≈ J(θ) + ∇J(θ)^T (θ' - θ) + 1/2 (θ' - θ)^T H(θ) (θ' - θ)$, where $∇J(θ)$ is the gradient of $J$ with respect to $θ$, and $H(θ)$ is the Hessian matrix.

2. Relate Parameter Changes to Metric Changes:
   
   Express $(θ' - θ)$ in terms of $ΔM_i$ [4][12]: 
   
   For $M_{SVD}$ and $M_{CE}$: 
   
   $θ' - θ ≈ -∂θ/∂M_i * ΔM_i$ (note the negative sign)
   
   For $M_{CS}$: 

   $θ' - θ ≈ ∂θ/∂M_i * ΔM_i$

3. Substitute into Taylor Expansion:
   
   For $M_{SVD}$ and $M_{CE}$:
   
   $J(θ') ≈ J(θ) - ∇J(θ)^T (∂θ/∂M_i * ΔM_i) + 1/2 (ΔM_i)^T (∂θ/∂M_i)^T H(θ) (∂θ/∂M_i) ΔM_i$
   
   For $M_{CS}$:
   
   $J(θ') ≈ J(θ) + ∇J(θ)^T (∂θ/∂M_i * ΔM_i) + 1/2 (ΔM_i)^T (∂θ/∂M_i)^T H(θ) (∂θ/∂M_i) ΔM_i$

4. Take Expectation of Both Sides:
   
   For $M_{SVD}$ and $M_{CE}$:

   $E[J(θ')] ≈ J(θ) - E[∇J(θ)^T (∂θ/∂M_i * ΔM_i)] + 1/2 E[(ΔM_i)^T (∂θ/∂M_i)^T H(θ) (∂θ/∂M_i) ΔM_i]$
   
   For $M_{CS}$:
   
   $E[J(θ')] ≈ J(θ) + E[∇J(θ)^T (∂θ/∂M_i * ΔM_i)] + 1/2 E[(ΔM_i)^T (∂θ/∂M_i)^T H(θ) (∂θ/∂M_i) ΔM_i]$

5. Analyze Each Term:
   
   $J(θ)$ is constant with respect to the expectation: 
   
   $E[∇J(θ)^T (∂θ/∂M_i * ΔM_i)] = ∇J(θ)^T (∂θ/∂M_i * E[ΔM_i])$ (linearity of expectation) [27], the last term is positive semi-definite if $H(θ)$ is positive semi-definite, which is true for convex $J$ [3][26].

6. Correlation Between Metric Improvements:
   
   Using these derivations from section B.2.2:
   - For $M_{SVD}: ∂J/∂M_{SVD}(i) > 0$ [1][25].
   - For $M_{CE}: ∂J/∂M_{CE}(i) > 0$ [9][12].
   - For $M_{CS}: ∂J/∂M_{CS}(i) > 0$ [2][23].

   Results in the following conclusions:

   For $M_{SVD}$: $E[ΔJ(θ)] ≈ -∇J(θ)^T (∂θ/∂M_{SVD} * E[ΔM_{SVD}]) > 0$ when $ΔM_{SVD} > 0$
   
   For $M_{CE}$: $E[ΔJ(θ)] ≈ -∇J(θ)^T (∂θ/∂M_{CE} * E[ΔM_{CE}]) > 0$ when $ΔM_{CE} > 0$
   
   For $M_{CS}$: $E[ΔJ(θ)] ≈ ∇J(θ)^T (∂θ/∂M_{CS} * E[ΔM_{CS}]) < 0$ when $ΔM_{CS} < 0$

   The second-order term adds a small positive value, but for sufficiently small $ΔM_i$, the first-order term dominates.

8. Generalization:
   
   This proof holds for small changes in the metrics. For larger changes, the change can be considered as a series of small steps, and this proof applied iteratively.

## B.3 Metric Interdependencies and Interaction Effects

### B.3.1 Interaction Functions

To analyze the interdependencies between the SVD, CE, and CS metrics, interaction functions are defined that capture how changes in one metric affect the others and, consequently, the overall objective function $J(θ)$.

#### B.3.1.1 Interaction Function Introduction

For any two metrics $M_i$ and $M_j$, where $i, j ∈ {SVD, CE, CS}$, we define the pairwise interaction function $f_{i,j}$ as:

$f_{i,j}(M_i, M_j) = ∂²J / (∂M_i ∂M_j)$ [5, 26]

This function quantifies how changes in $M_i$ affect the sensitivity of $J$ to changes in $M_j$, and vice versa.

Therefore the three-way interaction among all metrics, are defined as:

$f_{SVD,CE,CS}(M_{SVD}, M_{CE}, M_{CS}) = ∂³J / (∂M_{SVD} ∂M_{CE} ∂M_{CS})$ [33, 40]

This function captures the combined effect of simultaneous changes in all three metrics on $J$.

#### B.3.1.3 Properties of Interaction Functions

1. Continuity: All interaction functions are assumed to be continuous in their arguments, ensuring smooth transitions in the optimization landscape [27].

   $∀ε>0, ∃δ>0$ such that $||(M'_i, M'_j) - (M_i, M_j)|| < δ ⇒ |f_{i,j}(M'_i, M'_j) - f_{i,j}(M_i, M_j)| < ε$

2. Symmetry: Pairwise interaction functions are symmetric with respect to their arguments [5].

   $f_{i,j}(M_i, M_j) = f_{j,i}(M_j, M_i)$

3. Boundedness: Interaction functions are bounded within a finite range to ensure stability in optimization [26].

   $∃K>0$ such that $|f_{i,j}(M_i, M_j)| ≤ K$ for all $M_i$, $M_j$ in their respective domains

4. Differentiability: Interaction functions are differentiable with respect to their arguments, allowing for gradient-based analysis [27].

   $∂f_{i,j}/∂M_i$ and $∂f_{i,j}/∂M_j$ exist and are continuous

### B.3.2 Interaction Analysis

This section examines the pairwise interactions between the SVD, CE, and CS metrics, providing insights into how changes in one metric affect another and their combined impact on the objective function $J(θ)$.

#### B.3.2.1 SVD-CE Interaction: $f_{SVD,CE}(M_{SVD}, M_{CE})$ 

The interaction between the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Cross-Entropy (CE) metrics is defined as:

$f_{SVD,CE}(M_{SVD}, M_{CE}) = ∂²J / (∂M_{SVD} ∂M_{CE})$ 

This interaction captures how changes in the SVD metric affect the sensitivity of $J$ to changes in the CE metric, and vice versa [1].

**Theorem B.3.2.1.1:** The SVD-CE interaction is generally positive, i.e., $f_{SVD,CE}(M_{SVD}, M_{CE}) > 0$ for most values of $M_{SVD}$ and $M_{CE}$ in the context of LALR fine-tuning [35].

*Justification:* 
Let $σ_i$ be the $i$-th singular value and $H_i$ be the entropy of the $i$-th layer. Then:

$f_{SVD,CE}(M_{SVD}, M_{CE}) ≈ ∑_i ∂²J / (∂σ_i ∂H_i) > 0$ 

This inequality holds because LALR applies higher learning rates to layers with high $M_{SVD}$ (low singular values) and high $M_{CE}$ (low entropy). This approach leads to:

1. An increase in $M_{SVD}$ results in higher learning rates for layers with low singular values, which will increase the model's overall capacity and expressiveness over time [1].
2. An increase in $M_{CE}$ results in higher learning rates for low-entropy layers, which will increase the model's overall entropy over time [9].

Both of these effects contribute to decreasing $J$ in the LALR framework, as they promote improved representation capacity and diversification of the model's features.

**Corollary B.3.2.1.2:** The positive interaction between SVD and CE in the context of LALR suggests that optimizing these metrics together can lead to synergistic improvements in $J$.

#### 3.2.2 SVD-CS Interaction: $f_{SVD,CS}(M_{SVD}, M_{CS})$

The interaction between the SVD and Cosine Similarity (CS) metrics is defined as:

$f_{SVD,CS}(M_{SVD}, M_{CS}) = ∂²J / (∂M_{SVD} ∂M_{CS})$

This interaction quantifies how changes in the SVD metric influence the effect of CS changes on $J$, and vice versa [2].

**Theorem B.3.2.2.1:** The SVD-CS interaction is generally positive, i.e., $f_{SVD,CS}(M_{SVD}, M_{CS}) > 0$ for most values of $M_{SVD}$ and $M_{CS}$ in the context of LALR fine-tuning.

*Justification:* 
Let $σ_i$ be the $i$-th singular value and $θ_{ij}$ be the angle between weight vectors of layers $i$ and $j$. Then:

$f_{SVD,CS}(M_{SVD}, M_{CS}) ≈ ∑_{i,j} ∂²J / (∂σ_i ∂θ_{ij}) > 0$ 

This inequality holds because LALR applies higher learning rates to layers with high $M_{SVD}$ (low singular values) and high $M_{CS}$ (high cosine similarity). This approach leads to:

1. An increase in $M_{SVD}$ results in higher learning rates for layers with low singular values, which will increase the model's overall capacity and expressiveness over time [2].
2. An increase in $M_{CS}$ results in higher learning rates for layers with high cosine similarity, which will increase the average angle between weight vectors over time [23].

Both of these effects contribute to decreasing $J$ in the LALR framework, as they promote improved representation capacity and orthogonalization of the model's features.

**Corollary B.3.2.2.2:** The positive interaction between SVD and CS in the context of LALR suggests that these metrics can be optimized together effectively, to leading to compounding improvements in $J$.

#### B.3.2.3 CE-CS Interaction: $f_{CE,CS}(M_{CE}, M_{CS})$ 

The interaction between the CE and CS metrics is defined as:

$f_{CE,CS}(M_{CE}, M_{CS}) = ∂²J / (∂M_{CE} ∂M_{CS})$

This interaction describes how changes in the CE metric affect the impact of CS changes on $J$, and vice versa.

**Theorem B.3.2.3.1:** The CE-CS interaction is generally positive, i.e., $f_{CE,CS}(M_{CE}, M_{CS}) > 0$ for most values of $M_{CE}$ and $M_{CS}$ in the context of LALR fine-tuning.

*Justification:* 
Let $H_i$ be the entropy of the $i$-th layer and $θ_{ij}$ be the angle between weight vectors of layers $i$ and $j$. Then:

$f_{CE,CS}(M_{CE}, M_{CS}) ≈ ∑_{i,j} ∂²J / (∂H_i ∂θ_{ij}) > 0$

This inequality holds because LALR applies higher learning rates to layers with high $M_{CE}$ (low entropy) and high $M_{CS}$ (high cosine similarity). This approach leads to:

1. An increase in $M_{CE}$ results in higher learning rates for low-entropy layers, which will increase the model's overall entropy over time [9].
2. An increase in $M_{CS}$ results in higher learning rates for layers with high cosine similarity, which will increase the average angle between weight vectors over time [17].

Both of these effects contribute to decreasing $J$ in the LALR framework, as they promote diversification and orthogonalization of the model's representations.

**Corollary B.3.2.3.2:** The positive interaction between CE and CS in the context of LALR suggests that these metrics can be optimized together effectively, leading to synergistic improvements in $J$.

**Corollary B.3.2.3.3:** The positive interaction implies that focusing on layers with both high $M_{CE}$ and high $M_{CS}$ for increased learning rates can lead to compounding benefits, as improvements in one metric are likely to support improvements in the other.

#### B.3.2.4 Implications for LALR Enhancement 

The analysis of pairwise interactions provides the following insights for the LALR enhancement process:

1. The positive SVD-CE, SVD-CS, and CE-CS interactions suggest that these pairs of metrics can be improved effectively in sequence and lead to compounding enhancements [34].

2. The consistently positive interactions indicate that the LALR approach of increasing learning rates for layers with high metric values can lead to synergistic improvements [36].

3. The relative nature of these interactions supports the sequential improvement of SVD, CE, and CS metrics, justified as follows:

   a) Enhancing SVD first establishes a more expressive model structure by focusing on layers with low singular values, creating a favorable foundation for overall model improvement.
   
   b) The positive SVD-CE interaction implies that CE improvement benefits from the prior SVD enhancements, as both target layers that can benefit from increased plasticity.
   
   c) The positive SVD-CS and CE-CS interactions indicate that CS improvement can effectively build upon both SVD and CE enhancements, promoting orthogonalization of weight vectors while maintaining expressiveness and diversity.
   
   d) The consistently positive interactions suggest that each subsequent improvement step can leverage the enhancements from the previous steps.

The total improvement in the objective function $J$ for the SVD-CE-CS sequence can be expressed as:

$ΔJ_{total} = ΔJ_{SVD} + ΔJ_{CE(SVD)} + ΔJ_{CS(SVD,CE)}$

Where $ΔJ_{CE(SVD)}$ represents the improvement in CE given prior SVD enhancement, and $ΔJ_{CS(SVD,CE)}$ represents the improvement in CS given both prior enhancements.

These interaction patterns:

1. $ΔJ_{CE(SVD)} > ΔJ_{CE}$ (due to positive SVD-CE interaction)
2. $ΔJ_{CS(SVD,CE)} > ΔJ_{CS(SVD)}$ (due to positive CE-CS interaction)
3. $ΔJ_{CS(SVD)} > ΔJ_{CS}$ (due to positive SVD-CS interaction)

suggests the SVD-CE-CS sequence yields better overall improvement compared to isolated enhancements:

$ΔJ_{SVD} + ΔJ_{CE(SVD)} + ΔJ_{CS(SVD,CE)} > ΔJ_{SVD} + ΔJ_{CE} + ΔJ_{CS}$

This sequential enhancement approach allows each step to build upon the improvements of the previous steps in a complementary manner. The SVD enhancement provides a strong foundation, the CE improvement leverages and enhances this foundation, and the CS improvement then fine-tunes the model structure while benefiting from the prior enhancements.

The pairwise interaction analysis illuminates the complex interplay between the LALR metrics and provides a theoretical basis for their sequential improvement. This insight is crucial for designing effective LALR strategies that fully leverage the interdependencies between metrics to achieve substantial improvements in the objective function $J(θ)$.

#### B.3.2.5 Higher-Order Interactions

While the previous sections focused on pairwise interactions between the SVD, CE, and CS metrics, there are potential negative effects for three-way interactions among all three metrics to exist. However, the positive pairwise interactions suggests that these higher-order interactions are likely to be positive, based on the following:

1. Complementary Metrics:
   The metrics form a comprehensive framework for assessing layer quality:
   a) SVD optimizes individual layer performance
   b) CE ensures diverse contributions across layers
   c) CS promotes efficient use of the model's capacity
   
   Mathematical relationship:
   Let $f(SVD, CE, CS)$ represent the model's performance. The complementary nature suggests:
   
   $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial SVD \partial CE} > 0, \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial SVD \partial CS} > 0, \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial CE \partial CS} > 0$
   
   This positive interdependence indicates that improvements in one metric enhance the effects of the others.

2. Supermodularity:
   For a set function $f : 2^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, supermodularity is defined as:
   
   $f(S \cup \{i, j\}) - f(S \cup \{i\}) \geq f(S \cup \{j\}) - f(S)$, for all $S \subseteq N$ and $i, j \notin S$
   
   In the LALR context, this extends to higher-order interactions:

   $f(SVD, CE, CS) - f(SVD, CE) \geq f(SVD) - f(\emptyset)$
   
   $f(SVD, CE, CS) - f(SVD, CS) \geq f(CE) - f(\emptyset)$
   
   $f(SVD, CE, CS) - f(CE, CS) \geq f(SVD) - f(\emptyset)$
   
   These inequalities suggest that simultaneous improvements in all three metrics yield compounding benefits, exceeding the sum of individual improvements.

3. Information Theoretic Perspective:
   Let $I(Model)$ represent the model's information processing capability:
   
   $I(Model) \approx f(C_{SVD}, H_{CE}, M_{CS})$
   
   Where $C_{SVD}$ is the channel capacity derived from SVD, $H_{CE}$ is the entropy measure from CE, and $M_{CS}$ is the mutual information implied by CS.
   
   The data processing inequality suggests:
   
   $I(Model) \geq \max(I_{SVD}, I_{CE}, I_{CS})$
   
   Where $I_{SVD}$, $I_{CE}$, and $I_{CS}$ are the information measures from individual metrics.
   
   This inequality indicates the combined effect of the three metrics on the model's information processing capability is at least as positive as their individual effects.

4. Robustness to Negative Effects:
   For negative higher-order interactions to negate the overall positive effect:
   
   $\left|\frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial SVD \partial CE \partial CS}\right| > \min\left(\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial SVD \partial CE}, \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial SVD \partial CS}, \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial CE \partial CS}\right)$
   
   This inequality is unlikely to hold consistently across the parameter space, due to the complementary nature of the metrics, which would mean that the positive pairwise interactions are likely to dominate, ensuring overall positive effects when sequentially using these metrics during fine-tuning.

5. Local Convexity in High-Dimensional Spaces:
   In high-dimensional spaces, the probability of encountering locally convex regions increases. For an n-dimensional space:

   $P(\text{local convexity}) \approx 1 - O(e^{-n})$
   
   This exponential relationship confirms that as the number of model parameters grows, the likelihood of operating in locally convex regions during fine-tuning increases. In these regions, higher-order derivatives are more likely to be non-negative, which means that improvements in one metric are less likely to negatively impact the others.

6. Monotonicity:
   Let $f(M_{SVD}, M_{CE}, M_{CS})$ represent the overall effect on the objective function. Positive pairwise interactions imply:
   
   $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial M_i \partial M_j} \geq 0$ for all $i, j \in \{SVD, CE, CS\}$
   
   Extending to three-way interactions:
   
   $\frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial M_{SVD} \partial M_{CE} \partial M_{CS}} \geq 0$
   
   This suggests that improvements in any metric are likely to enhance the positive effects of improvements in the other metrics.

7. Sperner's Lemma Application:
   Let $S$ be the simplicial complex formed by the three metrics. Sperner's Lemma states:
   
   If all pairwise interactions (edges of $S$) are positive, $\exists$ point $p \in S$ where the three-way interaction is non-negative.
   
   While this doesn't guarantee global non-negativity, it supports the existence of regions with positive higher-order interactions that indicates sustained improvement across all metrics simultaneously.

#### B.3.2.6 Bounds on Interaction Effects

Establishing bounds on interaction effects between the SVD, CE, and CS metrics serves the following functions in the LALR framework:

- Stability: Upper and lower interaction limits illustrate LALR's safeguards against uncontrolled behavior during fine-tuning.
- Theoretical Foundation: Analysis of the interaction bounds substantiates LALR's potential effectiveness.
- Optimization Strategy: Analysis of the integration bounds yields insights into the relationships between each metric's focus, which support the metric optimization sequencing order
- Convergence Behavior: Interaction bounds illuminate LALR's long-term behavior, indicating how improvements may evolve as fine-tuning progresses.

The subsequent theorems establish these bounds and explore their implications for the LALR fine-tuning process.

**Theorem B.3.2.6.1 (Bounds on Pairwise Interactions):**
For any two metrics $M_i$ and $M_j$, where $i, j ∈ {SVD, CE, CS}$, the magnitude of their interaction is bounded:

$K_{ij}^{min} · max(|∂J/∂M_i|, |∂J/∂M_j|) ≤ |f_{i,j}(M_i, M_j)| ≤ K_{ij}^{max} · min(|∂J/∂M_i|, |∂J/∂M_j|)$

where $K_{ij}^{min}$ and $K_{ij}^{max}$ are constants depending on the specific pair of metrics.

*Justification:* 
The upper bound is derived from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, while the lower bound ensures a minimum level of interaction, reflecting the synergistic nature of the metrics in LALR.

**Theorem B.3.2.6.2 (Metric-Specific Interaction Properties):**

1. SVD Interactions:
a) As $M_{SVD}$ approaches its optimal state (low singular values), $|∂J/∂M_{SVD}|$ decreases.
b) $f_{SVD,CE}$ and $f_{SVD,CS}$ may weaken as $M_{SVD}$ improves, but remain positive.

2. CE Interactions:
a) $M_{CE}$ doesn't have a global optimal state, but seeks to maximize entropy differences between layers.
b) $f_{SVD,CE}$ and $f_{CE,CS}$ remain consistently positive across the range of $M_{CE}$ values.

3. CS Interactions:
a) Like $M_{CE}$, $M_{CS}$ doesn't have a global optimal state, but aims to minimize cosine similarity between layers.
b) $f_{SVD,CS}$ and $f_{CE,CS}$ maintain positive values regardless of the current $M_{CS}$ state.

*Justification:* 
These properties follow from the definitions and behaviors of each metric as described in earlier sections. The consistent positivity of interactions aligns with the LALR approach of applying higher learning rates to layers with higher metric values.

**Theorem B.3.2.6.3: (Conditions for Maximizing Positive Interactions):**

The positive interaction between metrics $M_i$ and $M_j$ is maximized under the following conditions:

1. For SVD: $M_{SVD}$ is high, indicating low singular values and high potential for improvement.
2. For CE and CS: The relative differences in entropy (CE) or cosine similarity (CS) between layers are large.
3. The gradients $∂J/∂M_i$ and $∂J/∂M_j$ are aligned.
4. The layers affected by $M_i$ and $M_j$ exhibit a high degree of interdependence in the network architecture.

*Justification:* 
Analysis of the interaction function $f_{i,j}(M_i, M_j)$ under these conditions demonstrates that they lead to the largest positive values of the second partial derivative $∂²J/(∂M_i ∂M_j)$.

**1.High $M_{SVD}$ (for SVD metric)**

High $M_{SVD}$ values, indicating low singular values and high improvement potential, maximize positive interactions due to:

a) Larger $∂J/∂M_{SVD}$ when singular values are low, indicating greater room for improvement.
b) Amplified effect of changes in other metrics (CE or CS) on $J$ when the layer has high improvement potential.

Mathematical expression:
$|∂²J/(∂M_{SVD} ∂M_j)| ∝ 1/σ_min$, where $σ_min$ is the smallest singular value.

As $σ_min$ approaches zero (high $M_{SVD}$), the interaction magnitude increases.

**2. Large relative differences in entropy or cosine similarity**

For CE and CS metrics, large relative differences between layers lead to stronger interactions:

a) CE: Larger entropy differences imply more distinct information content between layers, amplifying the effect of changes in other metrics.
b) CS: Larger cosine similarity differences indicate more diverse representations, enhancing the impact of changes in other metrics.

Mathematical expressions:

$|∂²J/(∂M_{CE} ∂M_j)| ∝ |H_max - H_min|$

$|∂²J/(∂M_{CS} ∂M_j)| ∝ |CS_max - CS_min|$

Where $H$ represents entropy and $CS$ represents cosine similarity.

**3. Aligned gradients $∂J/∂M_i$ and $∂J/∂M_j$**

Alignment of gradients of $J$ with respect to $M_i$ and $M_j$ maximizes their combined effect, leading to a positive interaction:

$∂²J/(∂M_i ∂M_j) ≈ (∂J/∂M_i · ∂J/∂M_j) / ||∂J/∂M_i|| ||∂J/∂M_j||$

The right-hand side reaches its maximum when the gradients are perfectly aligned, resulting in the largest positive interaction value.

**4. Layer interdependence**

High interdependence between layers affected by $M_i$ and $M_j$ in the network architecture causes changes in one metric to influence the other. This interdependence is quantifiable using measures such as mutual information or correlation between layer activations.

Let $I(L_i; L_j)$ represent the mutual information between layers $i$ and $j$, then:

$|∂²J/(∂M_i ∂M_j)| ∝ I(L_i; L_j)$

As mutual information increases, the interaction magnitude increases correspondingly.

**5. Conclusion**

The combination of these conditions yields the overall interaction expression:

$∂²J/(∂M_i ∂M_j) ≈ K · (1/σ_min) · |ΔM| · cos(θ) · I(L_i; L_j)$

Where:
- $K$ is a positive constant
- $σ_min$ is the minimum singular value (relevant for SVD)
- $|ΔM|$ represents the relative difference in entropy or cosine similarity
- $θ$ is the angle between $∂J/∂M_i$ and $∂J/∂M_j$
- $I(L_i; L_j)$ is the mutual information between affected layers

This formulation demonstrates that the conditions stated in Theorem 3.2.5.3 collectively lead to the largest positive values of $∂²J/(∂M_i ∂M_j)$, thus maximizing the positive interactions between metrics.

**6. Implications for LALR Optimization:**

1. Adaptive Improvement: The bounds on interactions suggest that the improvement potential varies throughout the fine-tuning process, with larger gains early on, especially for SVD.

2. Sustained Progress: The positive lower bound on interactions ensures that LALR continues to make progress even as some metrics (particularly SVD) approach more optimal states.

3. Dynamic Optimization Strategy: To maximize LALR benefits, the fine-tuning process should:
   a) Initially prioritize layers with high $M_{SVD}$ values.
   b) Continuously reassess and target layers with high relative CE and CS values.
   c) Adjust the sequencing of metric optimizations based on the current gradient alignments and layer interdependencies.

4. Convergence Behavior: The interaction bounds provide insights into LALR's convergence. While improvements from SVD optimization may slow over time, the relative nature of CE and CS ensures ongoing optimization potential.

5. Robustness: The existence of both upper and lower bounds indicates that LALR is robust across various model states and architectures, maintaining effectiveness throughout the fine-tuning process.

### B.3.3 Interaction and Bound Analysis Summary 

The analysis of metric interactions and their bounds justifies that enhancing SVD first, followed by CE, and finally CS for the LALR approach is most effective:

1. Synergistic Effects: SVD has positive interactions with both CE and CS. Enhancing SVD first maximizes the potential benefits of these interactions in subsequent steps (Theorem B.3.2.1.1 and Theorem B.3.2.2.1).

2. Global vs. Relative Metrics: Unlike CE and CS, which are relative metrics between layers, SVD provides a more global view of each layer's capacity. Addressing this global aspect first ensures that subsequent relative improvements (CE and CS) occur in a more balanced and expressive network structure.

3. Diminishing Returns: The impact of increasing SVD may decrease as layers approach optimal states. By prioritizing SVD early, we capitalize on its highest potential for improvement (Theorem B.3.2.6.2).

4. Cascade Effect: Improvements in SVD can lead to more meaningful relative differences for CE and CS improvements. This cascade effect is more pronounced when SVD is enhanced first, setting the stage for more effective CE and CS focused fine-tuning enhancements.

5. Stability: Starting with SVD provides a stable beginning to the optimization process, as it directly addresses the fundamental expressiveness of each layer. This stability supports more nuanced enhancement in subsequent steps.

6. CE Enhancement: Increasing the entropy of individual layers through CE enhancement effectively spreads out the vector space and angles between layer representations. This process creates a more diverse and informative feature space, setting the stage for subsequent CS enhancement.

7. Expanded Feature Space: Improving CE first allows the model to explore a wider range of feature combinations and representations, increasing the potential for discovering novel and task-relevant patterns. This expanded feature space provides a more favorable environment for CS enhancement. The CE-CS interaction analysis not only supports the overall enhancement sequence of SVD, CE, and CS but also highlights the critical role of CE improvement in creating a more optimal environment for subsequent fine-tuning steps.

8. CS Enhancement: By prioritizing CE improvement, we ensure that CS enhancement can fully leverage the increased diversity and expressiveness of the layer representations, leading to more substantial improvements in the overall performance of the model. In contrast, enhancing CS before CE would be less effective, as it would be operating on a more limited feature space.

Altogether, this rationale reinforces the theoretical foundations of the LALR approach and provides justification for LALR's SVD->CE->CS fine-tuning sequence. 

## B.4. Analysis of LALR's Impact on Layer Performance Gap

The Layer-Adaptive Learning Rate (LALR) approach aims to reduce the performance gap between layers by adjusting learning rates for layers with less desired characteristics. This strategy intends to result in more efficient use of computational resources by improving the performance of underperforming layers. This analysis provides a theoretical framework to show how LALR's contribution to model improvement can be achieved through this targeted enhancement.

### B.4.1 Layer Performance Dynamics

Let $L = \{l_1, ..., l_n\}$ represent the set of layers in the model. For each layer $l_i$, the following definitions apply:

1. $P(l_i, t)$: Performance of layer $l_i$ at time $t$
2. $M_j(l_i, t)$: Value of metric $j$ for layer $l_i$ at time $t$, where:
   - $M_{SVD}(l_i, t)$ is an absolute metric
   - $M_{CE}(l_i, t)$ and $M_{CS}(l_i, t)$ are relative metrics
3. $\eta(l_i, t)$: Learning rate for layer $l_i$ at time $t$

Assumptions:
1. Higher metric scores indicate greater potential for improvement.
2. The learning rate $\eta(l_i, t)$ is directly proportional to the metric scores:

   $\eta(l_i, t) \propto \sum_j w_j M_j(l_i, t)$

   where $w_j$ represents weight coefficients for each metric.

#### B.4.2 Layer Performance Gap

The layer performance gap at time $t$ is defined as:

$G(t) = \max_{l_i \in L} P(l_i, t) - \min_{l_i \in L} P(l_i, t)$

**Theorem B.4.2.1 (Convergence of Layer Performances)**

Under LALR learning rate adjustment, the layer performance gap converges to a minimal value:

$\lim_{t \to \infty} G(t) \leq \varepsilon$

for some small $\varepsilon > 0$.

*Justification:*
1. Let $l_{low}$ and $l_{high}$ be the layers with least and most desired characteristics at time $t$, respectively.

2. Model the rate of performance change for a layer as:

   $\frac{dP(l_i, t)}{dt} = k \cdot \eta(l_i, t) \cdot (P_{max} - P(l_i, t))$

   where $k$ is a positive constant and $P_{max}$ is the theoretical maximum performance.

3. Given the direct relationship between $\eta(l_i, t)$ and metric scores, and assuming higher metric scores for $l_{low}$:

   $\eta(l_{low}, t) > \eta(l_{high}, t)$

4. Therefore:

   $\frac{dP(l_{low}, t)}{dt} > \frac{dP(l_{high}, t)}{dt}$

5. This implies that the performance of $l_{low}$ improves faster than $l_{high}$, reducing $G(t)$ over time.

6. As $G(t)$ approaches 0, the difference in learning rates diminishes due to the convergence of metric scores. This leads to the convergence of $G(t)$ to some minimal value $\varepsilon$.

### B.4.3 Adaptive Metric Integration

Let $M_j^{(e)}(l_i)$ be the value of metric $j \in \{SVD, CE, CS\}$ for layer $l_i$ at epoch $e$. Then:

For SVD: $M_{SVD}^{(e)}(l_i) = f_{SVD}(W_i^{(e-1)})$

For CE and CS: $M_{CE}^{(e)}(l_i) = f_{CE}(W_i^{(e-1)}, \{W_k^{(e-1)}\}_{k\neq i})$
                $M_{CS}^{(e)}(l_i) = f_{CS}(W_i^{(e-1)}, \{W_k^{(e-1)}\}_{k\neq i})$

where $W_i^{(e-1)}$ represents the weights of layer $l_i$ after epoch $e-1$, and $\{W_k^{(e-1)}\}_{k\neq i}$ represents the weights of all other layers.

The adaptive metric integration ensures that learning rate adjustment in each epoch considers the current state of the entire model throughout the fine-tuning process.

### B.4.4 Weight Update Dynamics

Let $W_i(t)$ be the weight matrix of layer $l_i$ at time $t$. The weight update rule in gradient descent can be expressed as:

$W_i(t+1) = W_i(t) - \eta(l_i, t) \cdot \nabla L(W_i(t))$

where $\nabla L(W_i(t))$ is the gradient of the loss function with respect to $W_i(t)$.

Given LALR's direct relationship between learning rates and metric scores:

For SVD: $\eta_{SVD}(l_i, t) \propto M_{SVD}(l_i, t)$
For CE and CS: $\eta_{CE,CS}(l_i, t) \propto w_{CE}M_{CE}(l_i, t) + w_{CS}M_{CS}(l_i, t)$

Where $w_{CE}$ and $w_{CS}$ are weighting factors for the relative metrics.

This leads to the following implications:

1. Targeted weight changes: $\|W_i(t+1) - W_i(t)\| \propto \eta(l_i, t)$
   
   Layers with less desired characteristics undergo larger weight updates, accelerating their improvement and closing the gap with better-performing layers.

2. Selective gradient amplification: $\|\partial W_i(t)/\partial t\| = \eta(l_i, t) \cdot \|\nabla L(W_i(t))\|$
   
   The larger $\eta(l_i, t)$ for layers with less desired characteristics amplifies their gradient updates, prioritizing their improvement and mitigating potential gradient vanishing issues in these critical layers.

3. Dynamic gap reduction:

   As layers with less desired characteristics improve, their relative standings adjust to refocus learning rate adjustments based on the current model state.

### B.4.5 Computational Efficiency Enhancement

LALR enhances computational efficiency by reducing the performance gap between layers, drawing inspiration from neuroplasticity in cognitive science. This section presents theoretical foundations for LALR's efficiency, stability, and convergence properties.

#### B.4.5.1 Computational Efficiency via Targeted Improvement

LALR achieves computational efficiency through:

1. Focused Parameter Updates: LALR prioritizes updates in layers with less desired characteristics, achieving meaningful performance improvements with smaller overall changes to the model's weights [1]. This targeted approach reduces unnecessary perturbations to well-performing layers, mitigating catastrophic forgetting [13].

2. Accelerated Convergence: By reducing performance gaps between layers, LALR leads to faster overall model convergence [2]. This acceleration stems from balanced improvement across all layers, preventing slowdowns typically caused by underperforming components.

3. Efficient Capacity Utilization: LALR utilizes the existing capacity of the model without increasing model size or complexity [3]. This approach maximizes information content per parameter, leading to more compact and efficient representations [14].

The efficiency gain can be quantified as:

$E = \frac{\Delta P_{LALR}}{\Delta P_{uniform}} \cdot \frac{T_{uniform}}{T_{LALR}}$

Where $\Delta P$ represents performance improvement and $T$ represents training time. LALR aims for $E > 1$, indicating greater performance improvement per unit of training time compared to uniform learning rate approaches.

#### B.4.5.2 Gradient Descent Dynamics and Stability in LALR

In LALR, the weight update rule for gradient descent optimization is:

$W^{(t+1)}_l = W^{(t)}_l - \eta_l \nabla L(W^{(t)}_l)$

where $W^{(t)}_l$ represents the weights of layer $l$ at time step $t$, and $\nabla L(W^{(t)}_l)$ is the gradient of the loss function $L$ with respect to these weights.

The layer-specific learning rate $\eta_l$ is defined as:

$\eta_l = \eta_0 \cdot f(M_{SVD}(l), M_{CE}(l), M_{CS}(l)) \cdot s$

where:
- $\eta_0$ is a base learning rate
- $f$ is a function of the layer's SVD, CE, and CS metrics, with $0 < f(\cdot) \leq 1$
- $s$ is a global scaling factor, $0 < s \leq 1$

This formulation ensures that $0 < \eta_l \leq \eta_0 \cdot s$ for all layers.

The weight updates are bounded for any layer $l$ and time step $t$:

$\|W^{(t+1)}_l - W^{(t)}_l\| \leq \eta_0 \cdot s \cdot \|\nabla L(W^{(t)}_l)\|$

The effective step size for each layer at each iteration is:

$\text{step size}_l^{(t)} = \eta_l \cdot \|\nabla L(W^{(t)}_l)\|$

LALR's approach to reducing learning rates, through both the layer-specific function $f$ and the global scaling factor $s$, generally improves stability during fine-tuning. This increased stability is achieved through:

1. Smaller update magnitudes, reducing the risk of overshooting optimal values.
2. Layer-specific learning rate modulation, preventing excessive changes in well-optimized layers.
3. Global learning rate reduction, maintaining overall update conservatism.

These stability-enhancing features allow LALR aim to maintain the model's pre-trained knowledge while allowing for task-specific adaptations during fine-tuning.

#### B.4.5.3 LALR Metric-Based Learning Rate Adjustment and Hessian Approximation

In second-order optimization methods, the optimal learning rate for a given layer is theoretically inversely proportional to the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix $H$ of the loss function:

$\eta_{\text{optimal}} \propto \frac{1}{\lambda_{\text{max}}(H)}$

However, direct computation of $H$ is computationally infeasible for large models. LALR addresses this challenge by utilizing layer-specific metrics as proxies for estimating the layer's sensitivity to weight updates:

$\eta_l \approx \frac{k}{g(M_{SVD}(l), M_{CE}(l), M_{CS}(l))}$

where $k$ is a scaling constant and $g$ is a function that approximates the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of the layer-specific Hessian.

LALR employs the following metrics, which indirectly capture aspects of the Hessian's information:

1. SVD Metric Approximation:
   $M_{SVD}(l) \approx \frac{1}{\text{trace}(H_l)}$

2. CE Metric Approximation:
   $M_{CE}(l) \approx -\log(\det(H_l))$

3. CS Metric Approximation:
   $M_{CS}(l) \approx \frac{\lambda_{\text{max}}(H_l)}{\lambda_{\text{min}}(H_l)}$

These metrics enable LALR to estimate an appropriate learning rate for each layer:

$\eta_l \approx \frac{k}{(1 - M_{SVD}(l)) \cdot e^{M_{CE}(l)} \cdot M_{CS}(l)}$

This formula's structure is theoretically motivated:

1. $(1 - M_{SVD}(l))$: Inversely related to the layer's sensitivity.
2. $e^{M_{CE}(l)}$: Exponentially scales the rate based on the layer's information content.
3. $M_{CS}(l)$: Scales the rate based on the layer's condition number.

These Hessian approximations, derived indirectly through LALR's metrics, illustrate its benefits. By capturing aspects of layer sensitivity (SVD), information content (CE), and numerical stability (CS) without explicit Hessian computations, LALR's method provides insight into the model's local geometry, which is reflected in the learning rate adjustments. This allows LALR to offer advantages typically associated with second-order optimization methods, but at a fraction of the computational cost.

#### B.4.5.4 Lyapunov Stability Analysis for LALR

A Lyapunov function $V(W)$ for LALR is defined as:

$V(W) = L(W) + \sum_{l} \alpha_l M_l(W)$

where $L(W)$ is the loss function, $M_l(W)$ represents the metric value (SVD, CE, or CS) for layer $l$, and $\alpha_l$ are non-negative weighting coefficients.

LALR promotes stability under the following conditions:

1. $V(W) > 0$ for all $W \neq W^*$, where $W^*$ is the optimal weight configuration.
2. $V(W^*) = 0$
3. $\frac{dV(W)}{dt} < 0$ for all $W \neq W^*$

The time derivative of $V(W)$ is:

$\frac{dV(W)}{dt} = -\eta(l) \cdot \left\|\frac{\partial L}{\partial W}\right\|^2 - \sum_{l} \alpha_l \eta(l) \cdot \frac{\partial M_l}{\partial W} \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial W}$

LALR's learning rate adjustment mechanism contributes to stability by:

1. Reducing learning rates for well-optimized layers, maintaining the negativity of the first term.
2. Prioritizing updates in layers with less desirable metric values, ensuring the second term remains non-positive.

These properties ensure $\frac{dV(W)}{dt} < 0$, indicating movement towards lower Lyapunov function values and improved stability during fine-tuning.

#### B.4.5.5 LALR Convergence and Performance Bounds

The convergence rate and generalization performance of the loss function $L(W)$, under the LALR learning rate adaptation, can be bounded as follows:

**Convergence Rate:**

The expected difference in loss between the weights at iteration $t$, $W^{(t)}$, and the optimal weights, $W^*$, is given by:

$E[L(W^{(t)}) - L(W^*)] \leq \frac{C}{\sqrt{t}} \prod_{l=1}^L (1 - \gamma_l(\epsilon_l))$

where:
- $C$ is a constant dependent on initial conditions and the smoothness of the loss function.
- $L$ is the total number of layers.
- $\gamma_l(\epsilon_l)$ is a layer-specific function, with $\epsilon_l$ representing the discrepancy between the layer's current state and its optimal state.

This bound indicates that LALR's adaptive learning rates enhance convergence, particularly when there are significant variations in the optimal learning rates across different layers. LALR's ability to fine-tune each layer's learning rate based on its specific characteristics allows for more efficient training and faster convergence compared to uniform learning rate methods.

**Generalization Performance:**

For the generalization errors of LALR and uniform learning rate approaches, denoted as $R_{LALR}(W)$ and $R_{uniform}(W)$ respectively, the bound is established as:

$R_{LALR}(W) \leq R_{uniform}(W) - \delta(\epsilon)$

where $\delta(\epsilon) > 0$ is a function of the maximum discrepancy $\epsilon$ between the metric scores of any two layers, defined as:

$\epsilon = \max_{i,j} |M(l_i) - M(l_j)|$

Here, $M(l_i)$ represents the combined metric score for layer $i$.

This bound demonstrates that LALR's performance advantage is greater when there are larger discrepancies between layers. By effectively addressing these discrepancies through layer-specific learning rate adjustments, LALR not only accelerates convergence but also enhances the generalization ability of the model, leading to improved overall performance.

#### B.4.5.6 Bias-Variance Trade-off in LALR

LALR optimizes the bias-variance trade-off at a layer level, leading to improved generalization. For a given layer $l$, the objective is to minimize:

$E_l = B_l^2 + V_l + \lambda \cdot C_l$

where $E_l$ is the expected error for layer $l$, $B_l$ and $V_l$ represent bias and variance respectively, and $C_l$ is a complexity term based on the layer's metrics. The $\lambda$ parameter controls the trade-off between fitting and complexity.

LALR's adaptive learning rate for layer $l$ is expressed as:

$\eta(l) = \eta_0 \cdot f(M_{SVD}(l), M_{CE}(l), M_{CS}(l))$

where $\eta_0$ is a base learning rate and $f$ is a function of the layer's metrics.

By adjusting $\eta(l)$ based on layer-specific metrics, LALR allows for:
1. Larger updates in high-bias layers (typically those with high SVD scores)
2. Smaller updates in high-variance layers (typically those with low CE or high CS scores)

This dynamic adjustment helps find an optimal balance between bias and variance for each layer, potentially leading to better overall generalization compared to uniform learning rate methods.

## B.5 Conclusion

LALR provides potential for reducing performance disparities between layers while improving overall model efficacy, based on the following key findings and implications:

1. **Theoretical Foundation via Metric-Objective Correlation (B.2.3)**:
   Improvements in the SVD, CE, and CS metrics correlate with reductions in the objective function $J(\theta)$, providing the basis for LALR's effectiveness:
   - For SVD and CE: $E[\Delta J(\theta)] \approx -\nabla J(\theta)^T (\partial\theta/\partial M * E[\Delta M]) > 0$ when $\Delta M > 0$
   - For CS: $E[\Delta J(\theta)] \approx \nabla J(\theta)^T (\partial\theta/\partial M_{CS} * E[\Delta M_{CS}]) < 0$ when $\Delta M_{CS} < 0$

2. **Synergistic Metric Interactions (B.3.2.5)**:
   Positive interactions between SVD, CE, and CS metrics lead to compounding benefits, enhancing LALR's overall effectiveness.

3. **Sequential Optimization Strategy (B.3.2.4, B.3.3)**:
   LALR's unique sequential optimization strategy (SVD → CE → CS) capitalizes on metric synergies, maximizing the impact of each optimization step.

4. **Bounded Interaction Effects (B.3.2.6)**:
   Established bounds on metric interactions $(K_{ij}^{min} \leq |f_{i,j}(M_i, M_j)| \leq K_{ij}^{max})$ provide insights into LALR's robustness and limitations across various scenarios.

5. **Implicit Hessian Approximation for Efficient Optimization (B.4.5.3)**:
   LALR's metric-based learning rate adjustments serve as an efficient approximation of second-order optimization techniques, capturing local geometry without the computational burden of explicit Hessian calculations.

6. **Lyapunov Stability Analysis (B.4.5.4)**:
   The Lyapunov function $V(W) = L(W) + \sum_l \alpha_l M_l(W)$ demonstrates LALR's ability to promote overall system stability while enabling targeted improvements in underperforming layers.

7. **Convergence and Generalization Bounds (B.4.5.5)**:
   Theoretical analysis demonstrates that LALR can achieve faster convergence and lower generalization error compared to non-layer adaptive learning rate approaches, especially with significant layer discrepancies:
   $E[L(W^{(t)}) - L(W^*)] \leq (C/\sqrt{t}) \prod_l(1 - \gamma_l(\varepsilon_l))$
   $R_{LALR}(W) \leq R_{uniform}(W) - \delta(\varepsilon)$

8. **Layer-Specific Bias-Variance Trade-off Optimization (B.4.5.6)**:
   LALR dynamically adjusts the bias-variance trade-off at each layer, allowing for more nuanced optimization and better generalization than non-layer adaptive learning rate methods.

LALR effectively addresses the challenges of layer-wise performance disparities and efficient capacity utilization through the synergistic interactions between carefully chosen metrics (SVD, CE, and CS) within a sequential and adaptive learning rate strategy.
